# NotesApp

A small grades application used throughout the Computer Security course. Teachers
record grades and comments for their classes, students read their own grades, and an
admin manages users and classes.

## Run it

You need Docker with the Compose plugin.

```
git clone git@github.com:KristenPire/NoteApp.git notesapp
cd notesapp
docker compose up
```

The first start builds the image, launches PostgreSQL, and loads the seed data
automatically. When it is ready, open:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Test accounts

| Role    | Username      | Password   |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Student | `alice`       | `alicepw`  |
| Teacher | `prof.turing` | `teach123` |
| Admin   | `admin`       | `admin123` |

(There are ~30 students in total; each student's password is their username + `pw`,
e.g. `bob` / `bobpw`.)

## Stack

- Python 3.11 + Flask (server-rendered Jinja2 pages and a small JSON API)
- PostgreSQL 15
- Docker Compose (`web` and `db` services)

## Reset

```
docker compose down -v   # wipes the database volume
docker compose up        # reloads the seed data
```
